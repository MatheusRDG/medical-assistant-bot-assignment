    "2. Open Generative QA: The answer generated by one of the retrieved options.\n",
    "    1. Using more complexity (in terms of memory and time) we can use a model to generate the answer. We rely in some pre-trained model knowledge better approach some queries variants.\n",

Counseling either one-on-one or in groups can help develop skills to stop or reduce drinking, develop reachable goals, manage the triggers that lead to alcohol misuse and build a strong social support system that supports healthy habits. There are many kinds of counseling approaches. - cognitive behavior therapy - motivational enhancement therapy - marital and family counseling - brief interventions cognitive behavior therapy motivational enhancement therapy marital and family counseling brief interventions Learn more about each type of behavioral therapy. Counseling can be provided by - primary care doctors - psychiatrists - psychologists - social workers - certified alcohol counselors. primary care doctors psychiatrists psychologists social workers certified alcohol counselors.\\n\\nOlder people with alcohol problems respond to treatment as well as younger people. Some studies suggest that older adults do better when they are treated with other people the same age instead of mixed in with younger adults. Some communities have treatment programs and support groups specifically for older adults.\\n\\nMost people with alcohol problems can be treated successfully. People with an alcohol use disorder and those who misuse alcohol and cannot stay within healthy drinking limits should stop drinking altogether. Others can cut back until their drinking is under control. Changing drinking habits isnt easy. Often it takes more than one try to succeed. But people dont have to go it alone. There are plenty of sources of help. (Watch the video to learn more about getting help for alcohol use disorder (AUD). To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. To reduce the video, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.) A doctor can help decide the best treatment for people with alcohol problems. Many people need more than one kind of treatment. Medicines can help people with an alcohol use disorder quit drinking. Meeting with a therapist or substance-abuse counselor or with a support group may also help. Support from family and friends is important, too. Making a change sooner rather than later makes treatment more likely to succeed. When treatment is successful, people have longer and longer periods without drinking alcohol. Finally, they are able to stop drinking or stick to healthy drinking limits. But treatment does not always work. Relapse is common among people who overcome alcohol problems. People with drinking problems are most likely to relapse during periods of stress or when exposed to people or places associated with past drinking.
