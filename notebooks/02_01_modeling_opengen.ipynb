    "    2. The problem with this (at this point) is don't know how good each topic of the dataset is represented in the dataset.\n",
    "2. Open Generative QA: The answer generated by one of the retrieved options.\n",
    "    1. Using more complexity (in terms of memory and time) we can use a model to generate the answer. We rely in some pre-trained model knowledge better approach some queries variants.\n",
    "    2. More complexity, more inference time, possible need GPU and not can generate no safety answer (considering the dataset is composed only by true/safe answers).\n",
    "3. Generative QA: The answer is a free text.\n",
    "    1. The same as the open generative QA but not always rely in the retrieved options.\n"

Sometimes, when the fluid reaches the angle, it passes too slowly through the meshwork drain, causing the pressure inside the eye to build.

However, studies have shown that the early detection and treatment of glaucoma, before it causes major vision loss, is the best way to control the disease. So, if you fall into one of the higher risk groups for the disease, make sure to have a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once every one to two years.

      "Question: What are the symptoms of Juvenile osteoporosis ?\n",
      "\n",
      "True Answer: What are the signs and symptoms of Juvenile osteoporosis? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Juvenile osteoporosis. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Bone pain 90% Recurrent fractures 90% Reduced bone mineral density 90% Gait disturbance 50% Kyphosis 7.5% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Low serum calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol) - Osteoporosis - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.\n",

      "Model Answer: \n",
      "I can provide information on that topic. \n",
      "\n",
      "The symptoms of Juvenile Osteoporosis, also known as Rickets in children and Osteomalacia in adults, typically appear during childhood or adolescence. They may include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Softening of the bones (dissolution of bone tissue)\n",
      "* Weakened bones\n",
      "* Bowing of the legs\n",
      "* Stunted growth\n",
      "* Deformities such as scoliosis or kyphosis\n",
      "* Pain and discomfort in the back, hips, or legs\n",
      "\n",
      "Please note that these symptoms can vary depending on the severity of the condition. If you suspect your child or adult has Juvenile Osteoporosis, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.\n",

Hashimotos Disease Hashimotos disease, also called chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States.1 Hashimotos disease is a form of chronic inflammation of the thyroid gland. Hashimotos disease is also an autoimmune disorder. Normally, the immune system protects the body against foreign invaderssuch as viruses and bacteriathat can cause illness. But in autoimmune diseases, the immune system attacks the bodys own cells and organs. With Hashimotos disease, the immune system attacks the thyroid, causing inflammation and interfering with its ability to produce thyroid hormones. More information is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Hashimotos Disease. Thyroiditis Thyroiditis causes stored thyroid hormone to leak out of the thyroid gland. At first, the leakage raises hormone levels in the blood, leading to hyperthyroidismwhen thyroid hormone levels are too highthat lasts for 1 or 2 months. Most people then develop hypothyroidism before the thyroid is completely healed. Several types of thyroiditis can cause hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism: - Subacute thyroiditis. This condition involves painful inflammation and enlargement of the thyroid. Experts are not sure what causes subacute thyroiditis, but it may be related to a viral or bacterial infection. The condition usually goes away on its own in a few months. - Postpartum thyroiditis. This type of thyroiditis develops after a woman gives birth. For more information, see the section titled What happens with pregnancy and thyroid conditions? - Silent thyroiditis. This type of thyroiditis is called silent because it is painless, as is postpartum thyroiditis, even though the thyroid may be enlarged. Like postpartum thyroiditis, silent thyroiditis is probably an autoimmune condition and sometimes develops into permanent hypothyroidism. Congenital Hypothyroidism Some babies are born with a thyroid that is not fully developed or does not function properly. If untreated, congenital hypothyroidism can lead to mental retardation and growth failure. Early treatment can prevent these complications, so most newborns in the United States are screened for hypothyroidism. Surgical Removal of the Thyroid When part of the thyroid is removed, the remaining part may produce normal amounts of thyroid hormone, but some people who have this surgery develop hypothyroidism. Removal of the entire thyroid always results in hypothyroidism. Part or all of the thyroid may be surgically removed as a treatment for - hyperthyroidism - a large goiter, which is an enlarged thyroid that may cause the neck to appear swollen and can interfere with normal breathing and swallowing - thyroid nodules, which are noncancerous tumors, called adenomas, or lumps in the thyroid that can produce excess thyroid hormone - thyroid cancer Radiation Treatment of the Thyroid Radioactive iodine, a common treatment for hyperthyroidism, gradually destroys the cells of the thyroid. Most people who receive radioactive iodine treatment eventually develop hypothyroidism. People with Hodgkins disease, other lymphomas, and head or neck cancers are treated with radiation, which can also damage the thyroid. Medications Some drugs can interfere with thyroid hormone production and lead to hypothyroidism, including - amiodarone, a heart medication - interferon alpha, a cancer medication - lithium, a bipolar disorder medication - interleukin-2, a kidney cancer medication</td>\n",

       "* **Autoimmune disorders**: In autoimmune diseases such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis or Graves' disease, the immune system attacks the thyroid gland, leading to inflammation and damage.\n",
